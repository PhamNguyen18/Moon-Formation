# Moon-Formation
A work in progress lunar accretion simulation. This code takes inspiration from the work of Salmon and Canup 2012 who used a hybrid hydro/ N-body code to model the accretion of the Moon. A 1D fluid is used to model the disk within the Roche limit and an N-body code outside of it. For this project I am using the open source N-body code [rebound](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound). The hydrocode will be custom built at a later time. 

TODO:
- Replicate results of Ida 1997
- Implement hydrocode
- Add drag forces to planetesimals 
- Come up with a clever repo name
